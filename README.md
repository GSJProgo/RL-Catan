# Reinforcement Learning for Catan: DQN/A3C Implementation

## Overview
This project presents a PyTorch-based implementation of two reinforcement learning algorithms: Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C) and Deep Q-learning. They are applied to a custom-designed, 2-player environment of the board game Catan, fully integrating the game's rules, except for player-player trading.

To train the reinforcement learning agents, you can adjust hyperparameters in the config file.

## Achievements
Both of the models have been optimized and tested using Ubuntu on WSL2.
- The A3C model demonstrates significant success, attaining an 87% win rate against a random agent as an opponent.
- The DQN model is currently under development, with anticipated improvements following the refinement of the A3C implementation.

## Project Status
Please note that this project is actively being developed. Further updates and enhancements are expected.
